Car Rental Project
This project was made by me to learn and strenghten my skills in C# programming. It's made using Visual Studio Forms in C#. 

The program is intented to be a car rental management tool for car rental companies. It has an admin UI, where you can add and delete listings for cars. 
The user UI allows the user to create an account, check car listigns and rent cars. 

Because I wanted to work on text files, the data is not saved in any database, but instead its saved in .txt files. Those files are then interpreted data is extracted.
