Car Rental Project
This project was made by me to learn and strenghten my skills in C# programming. It's made using Visual Studio Forms in C#. 
The program is intented to be a car rental management tool for car rental companies. It has an admin UI, where you can add, modify and delete listings for cars, check what cars are rented and check the metrics. The user UI allows the user to create an account, rent cars, manage already rented cars, leave reviews etc..
